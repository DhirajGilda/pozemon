# PomoZen ⏰
Pomodoro is a focus technique used to improve  focus. Your focus section (pomodoro) has 25 minutes, and you can use it to focus on learning, reading or any deep work, after that you have 5 minutes break (short break). Ofc if you want you can set custom timers. Enjoy!✌

# About project 🎯

This project was made while I was learning and exploring NextJS. It is a productivity tool that I had quite a lot of fun while building and also learned quite a lot from this. I had used redux previously but this time was the first for using redux persist for persisting the session settings and user login. There are still some features I plan on adding like - 

+ Changeable sequence of tasks in todolist
+ Detailed graph of session statistics
+ More themes
+ Support to connect users spotify playlist 
+ And some UI improvements
