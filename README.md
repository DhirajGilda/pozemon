# PomoZen ⏰
The pomodoro technique helps with concentration. You get a 25-minute focus portion (pomodoro) during which you can concentrate on reading, learning, or any other deep activity before taking a 5-minute brief break. Of course, you can set your own timers if you choose. Enjoy!✌

# About project 🎯

I created this app whilst I was researching and studying NextJS. It is a productivity tool that I built with a lot of enjoyment and gained a lot of knowledge from. Although I had previously used redux, this was the first time I had utilized redux persist to save the session settings and user login. There are still a few features I want to include, such as - 

+ Changeable sequence of tasks in todolist
+ Detailed graph of session statistics
+ More themes
+ Support to connect users spotify playlist 
+ And some UI improvements
